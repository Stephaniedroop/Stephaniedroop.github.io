This was my first conference talk. You can see a recording [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFG0YX0gv7w). I was overjoyed it was mid-morning on the first day, when everyone was enthusiastic and wide-awake. The room was packed but long and narrow, so not the most conducive to engagement. I got their interest by running up the aisle before I started and waving hi, "to see who I'm talking to". People liked that and put away their phones. Afterwards, I got a lot of questions from respected bigwigs in the field who noted the lack of models and were all itching to suggest their own approaches.
