For a year or two recently I used medium for my non-academic writing. I probably had a handful of different posts on there. Before that I had a wordpress, and before that (back in the dim and distant past) I had a livejournal. I wrote some stories I was half proud of, at the time. I'm sad I can't find them anywhere. Maybe I'll find and repost those medium posts, at least. Some of them give an insight into who I am and the projects I've done till now.

Now I spraff prolifically and joyously on the specialist machine learning and vajrayana discords I am on.
