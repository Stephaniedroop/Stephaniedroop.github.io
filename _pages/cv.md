{% include base_path %}

My career path has been wildly eclectic. I used to work in Russia and I was a chartered accountant for a while. I left that to pursue human knowledge. If I wasn't driven to understand the mind I would feed hundreds at a time from a large, stainless steel catering kitchen where I'd stir my steaming vats and add spices by the bucketload.

I'll be looking for a new job in September 2025. If you have any ideas I'd love to hear from you.
