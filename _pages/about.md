Hi, I'm Steph. Thanks for stopping by. This page is under construction at October 2023 so check back soon if there's someting you'd like to see.

My research is in _computational cognitive science_ which I like to explain as _doing psychology with the help of computer programs_.

Our field has an ongoing ambivalent relationship with the idea that _the mind is a computer and processes information like a computer_. Some take that as a strong and foundational assumption. Some, like me, operate on the weaker expression of _what can we tell about the mind if we treat it as a computer?_ Put another way, if we model tasks that people do with computer programs, can we reproduce patterns similar to what people do when they do the task? Can we help explain, predict and interpret human behaviour that way?

The specific human behaviour I work on is _goal inference_; how we read other people's intentions and decide what they must be doing from the ambiguous signs of their behaviour.

It feeds into wider metaphysical ideas of _what is an intention anyway_, _how do we think up creative explanations_, _what makes a good explanation and a good cause?_

Technical keywords for how we study this formally include _counterfactual reasoning_, _probabilistic models_, _Bayesian causal models_, _abduction_, _language of thought_ and _compositionality_. I hope to write more soon about how these fit together.

I'm funded by the centre for doctoral training for Natural Language Processing. Among many other subfields, NLP includes the large language models that have beome so popular in the last year or two and so I keep up broad working knowledge of AI ethics and other themes to do with AI and machine learning.

Outside uni I am pretty much obsessed with mountains (hill running, trail ultras, climbing) and Buddhist meditation so if you'd like to connect and geek out on either of those themes then by all means be my guest.
