During my first year or two in Russia I would go to all the expat bars and tell everyone I met that I was a freelance translator. Gradually work started coming in, as everyone needs a translator sooner or later and I was the recently visible one that came to mind.

I worked in several smallish market research companies and publishing houses, doing marketing, communications and b2b supplements. Full-length publications during this time included a guidebook to Moscow's cocktail bars and a lifestyle directory. You're not missing anything by not seeing them.

Then I went into more technical financial editing work and reduced my freelance work to occasional books with Sandermoen Publishing. See the Editing section for that.
